# GraphQL Server Practice

A practice GraphQL server project built using **Node.js**, **Apollo Server**, and **GraphQL schema definitions**. This project demonstrates how to build a simple movie-director database with fully functional queries and mutations, following GraphQL best practices.


## ðŸš€ Features

- GraphQL server setup using Apollo Server
- Schema definition with `Movie` and `Director` types
- Query and Mutation implementation
- Nested resolvers for relationships
- Sample in-memory data
- Input types for structured mutations


### Requerment
### structure
movies {
    id,
    title,
    publishedYear,
    rating,
    genre,              
    language,            
    director             
}

director {
    id,
    name,
    age,
    nationality,
    awards,              
    movies               
}
